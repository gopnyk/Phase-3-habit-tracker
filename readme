# Known issues:

1) Lines in "CTkinter design.py" from 1277 to 1285. I preferred the filter_habits() function to be present in graphs file,
but the filter habits function would return an empty dictionary - no data, no analysis. Made sure,
that they get the same input, but it still would not work.
